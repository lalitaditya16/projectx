PLAYER’S VALUE

Football is one of the most popular sport in the world. The use of data analysis has been vital
especially in the last few years.The best teams regularly invest millions into this field in order to achieve
competitive edge over its rival teams.We aim to develop a method for accurately valuing players based on
their on-field contributions. Our approach involves identifying key performance metrics, determining their
importance, and combining them into a formula to calculate a player’s overall value. This methodology
aims to provide football clubs, agents, and analysts with valuable insights for making informed decisions in
player recruitment, contract negotiations, and squad management
